Here is a summary of the courses I have taught (more details to follow).

#### Machine Learning in Fundamental Physics
Full lecture course providing an introduction to Machine Learning and its contemporary application in the physical sciences for Physics students. I have designed this new Master's course and taught in the summer term 2019, 2020, and 2021 at LMU Munich.

#### Supersymmetry
I taught this 24-hour Master course for the MMathPhys at the University of Oxford in 2017. Topics covered roughly correspond to [lecture notes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.1491) I co-authored.

#### Seminar on Effective Field Theories
During the winter term 2021/2022 I run a student seminar which covered chapters from Cliff Burgess book on Introduction to Effective Field Theories.

#### Seminar on Dualities
During the winter term 2020/2021 I am organised a student seminar which covers AdS/CFT, dualities in field theory, and dualities in string theory.

#### Seminar on Topics in String Compactifications
During the winter term 2019/2020 I offered a student seminar which covered topics in string phenomenology and potential experimental signatures of string theory.
