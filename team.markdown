I am closely working with postdoctoral researcher [Andreas Schachner](https://andreasschachner.github.io/)

I am very happy to be working with the following students:

- Kai Lehmann (with Jochen Weller)
- William Roster (with Mara Salvato, MPE)
- Silas Zelmer (with Esra Bulbul, MPE)
- Sam Tovey (visiting PhD student from ICP Stuttgart)
- Konstantin Nikolaou (ICP Stuttgart)
- Julian Ebelt (Master student)
- Valentin Kiendl (Master student)
- William Shellard (Master student)


Former students in our team were:

- Marc Syvaeri (PhD student): Symmetries &cap; ML
- Philip Betzler (PhD student): Physics dualities in ML
- Nicolas Baron Perez (Master student, co-supervised with Esra Bulbul): Machine learning cluster scaling relations
- Binh Ta (Master student): Holomorphic neural networks
- Abhishek Dubey (Master student): Structure in the string landscape with machine learning
- Sebastian Mayer (Master student): Sampling string theory vacua
- Yuyang Wang (Master student): Gravitational waves from scalar field dynamics
- Lukas Ranftl (Master student, co-supervised with Jochen Weller): Object detection algorithms to identify galaxy clusters
- Rene Kroepsch (Master student): Reinforcement learning for flux vacua 
- Felix Schmid (Master student): Complex structure moduli in Calabi-Yau compactifications
- Simon Schallmoser (Master student, co-supervised with Jochen Weller): Searching for axion-like particles with ML
- [Mathis Gerdes](https://mathisgerdes.github.io) (Master student): Differential geometry &cap; ML (-> PhD position in Amsterdam)
- Christoph Kohl (Bachelor student, with Volker Tresp): Hamiltonian Neural Networks
- Kai Gipp (Bachelor student): Kaluza-Klein theories


*If you are interested in joining our team to work on topics at the intersection of physics and machine learning, please feel free to contact me. We have available projects.*
