I am a physicist with a passion for artificial intelligence.

I work on a variety of topics in ranging from mathematical physics, cosmology, particle phenomenology to astrophysics. Nowadays, most of my time is spent at the interface of physics and machine learning. 

On this site you can find some information on my activities.
