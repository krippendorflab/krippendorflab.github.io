Symmetries are at the heart of our best models in fundamental physics, aka the Standard Model of Particle Physics and Cosmology.
Symmetries are at the heart of the best models in machine learning such as Convolutional Neural Networks.

With this anaphora I want to stress that mathematical structures have proven to be useful in two separate domains. By combining insights from both fields, we develop new techniques to improve simulations and to find new mathematical structures.

Identifying symmetries in data sets is generally difficult, but knowledge about them is crucial for efficient data handling. Here we present a method how neural networks can be used to identify symmetries. We make extensive use of the structure in the embedding layer of the neural network which allows us to identify whether a symmetry is present and to identify orbits of the symmetry in the input. To determine which continuous or discrete symmetry group is present we analyse the invariant orbits in the input. We present examples based on rotation groups SO(n) and the unitary group SU(2). Further we find that this method is useful for the classification of complete intersection Calabi-Yau manifolds where it is crucial to identify discrete symmetries on the input space. For this example we present a novel data representation in terms of graphs.
