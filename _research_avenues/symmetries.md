Symmetries are at the heart of our best models in fundamental physics, aka the Standard Model of Particle Physics and Cosmology.
Symmetries are at the heart of the best models in machine learning such as Convolutional Neural Networks.

With this anaphora I want to stress that mathematical structures have proven to be useful in two separate domains. By combining insights from both fields, we develop new techniques to improve simulations and to find new mathematical structures.
