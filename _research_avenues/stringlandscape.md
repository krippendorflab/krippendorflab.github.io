String theory is a wonderful framework for a quantum theory of all known interactions. What keeps puzzling me is whether we can find a way to test string theory experimentally? Although there are many possible signatures (e.g. axion-like particles), it is unclear at which scale below the Planck scale (~10^18 GeV) we can expect generic (~guaranteed) signatures arising from string theory. For example, a guaranteed signature of low-energy supersymmetry which addresses the electroweak hierarchy problem, is that there are new particles around the TeV scale (likely above the energy reach of the LHC).
To get an idea of what are the typical signatures we need to study samples from the set of consistent string theory solutions. There are two major hurdles:

1) How to construct consistent string theory solutions?

2) How to sample the vast set of solutions even in a class of string theory solutions?

Although traditional techniques have been applied to this problem for decades with steady progress (see my publication list for work in this direction), numerical methods seem inevitable in sampling this set efficiently. Recent ML advances in sampling from high-dimensional distributions (e.g. image sampling via GANs and Invertible NNs/flows) seem a promising new direction and we are working on using these techniques to gain new insights on our string theory solutions.
