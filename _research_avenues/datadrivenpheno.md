At a very coarse level particle physics phenomenology is about writing down effective field theories to describe more and more aspects of the Universe we observe, and to find clever ways of testing these models.

The way we typically come up with new models seems rather baroque as we use more or less the same tools of well-defined building blocks for decades (symmetries, extra-dimensions, power-law scalings, etc.) which provide us with a "handful" of models to examine and use. I have done exactly this type of physics in the past (see my publication list).

This is at first sight in contradiction with the success of deep over-parameterized neural networks which show remarkable performance on many but clearly not all tasks. This contradiction due to over-parameterization can be overcome when we know what the neural network is calculating.

By trying to figure out which features your ML algorithm is using and which simple (i.e. compressed into few parameters) models are behind the solutions found by a neural network, my aim is to identify more accurate phenomenological models and to find new ways of testing existing models.

In particular, this is about constraining axion-like particles, one promising dark matter candidate, and this is about improving phenomenological models used in astrophysics to sharpen our predictions on &Lambda;CDM cosmological parameters.


### [Accelerating the search for Axion-Like Particles with machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07642)

Machine learning (ML) techniques have been applied with tremendous success in many areas of physics. In this work, we use ML to place bounds on the coupling between photons and axion-like particles (ALPs). This coupling causes ALPs and photons to interconvert in the presence of a background magnetic field. This would lead to modulations in the spectra of point sources shining through the magnetic fields of galaxy clusters. This effect has already been used to place world-leading bounds on the ALP-photon coupling using conventional statistical methods. We train ML classification algorithms on simulated spectra from the Chandra X-ray telescope for a range of point sources and ALP-photon couplings. We then use the response of these algorithms to the real Chandra spectra to place bounds on ALP-photon interactions. We obtain bounds at a similar level to those based on other techniques, but find improvements on an individual source basis. We expect such search techniques to become increasingly important for ALP searches with future telescopes that will offer substantially higher energy resolution.
